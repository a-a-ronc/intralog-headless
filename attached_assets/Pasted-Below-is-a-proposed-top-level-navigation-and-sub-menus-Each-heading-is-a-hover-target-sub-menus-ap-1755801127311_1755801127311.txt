Below is a proposed top‑level navigation and sub‑menus. Each heading is a hover target; sub‑menus appear on hover with columns, similar to KPI and Fortna. Keep your existing styling (clean typography, muted colours, rounded cards) but extend the header to support these drop‑downs.

Solutions (what you design & build)
By Technology – Pallet Shuttles, Vertical Lift Modules (VLM), Conveyor & Sortation Systems, AMRs/AGVs, Warehouse Control & Execution Software (WCS/WES), Robotics (Piece Picking, Palletizing).
By Function – Storage & Retrieval, Picking & Packing, Buffering/Sequencing, Palletizing, Sortation.
By Industry – Retail & E‑Commerce, Food & Beverage, Manufacturing, Healthcare/Pharma, Third‑Party Logistics (3PL), Sporting Goods/Outdoors (custom if relevant).

Services (your integrator activities)
Consulting & Planning – Supply‑chain & network analysis, SKU profiling/ABC analysis, concept selection, vendor comparison.
Design & Engineering – Facility sizing & throughput modeling, simulation & digital twins, layout & slotting, specification drafting.
Implementation & Integration – Value engineering & procurement, installation & commissioning, controls integration (through partners).
Support – Training & on‑site start‑up, upgrades/retrofits (as needed), partner after‑sales programs.
These sections map directly to the first four activities in the integrator report
 and show clients that you handle projects from concept to go‑live while partnering for heavy manufacturing and service.

Industries
A simple drop‑down listing the verticals you serve (e.g., Mid‑market warehouses, Sporting Goods, Outdoor & Adventure, Apparel, Food & Beverage, Energy/Consumer Brands). Each link can lead to a landing page with a brief description and relevant showcase items.

Showcase (or “Projects”)
Use the improved project gallery you built earlier—highlighting customer stories (New Balance, Sportsman’s Warehouse, Little Giant, Lion Energy, Built Brands, etc.) with photos/videos/drawings. Keep a link in the Resources section to your future data‑heavy case studies once you have quantifiable metrics.

Resources
Combine your blog, news/events, and video content into one searchable library (similar to Fortna’s “Insights & Resources”). Include filters for Topic (Consulting, Automation, Software) and Content Type (Blog, Video, Project Highlight).

Company
Sub‑pages: About Us (mission & Tier‑3 positioning), Partners (technology partners & suppliers), Careers, Contact Us. Consider a “Why Choose Us” page emphasising your integrator tier, project size sweet spot, and ability to bridge manual to semi‑automated operations.

4. Implementing the mega‑menu

Your current navigation in components/Header.tsx is a simple horizontal list of Link elements
raw.githubusercontent.com
. To implement hover drop‑downs while keeping the same styling, you can modify Header.tsx to wrap each top‑level link in a div with Tailwind’s group utility, and reveal the submenu on group hover. Here’s an example for the Solutions item:
