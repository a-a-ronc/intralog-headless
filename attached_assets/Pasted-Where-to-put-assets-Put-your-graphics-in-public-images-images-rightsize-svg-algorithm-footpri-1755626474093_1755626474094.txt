Where to put assets

Put your graphics in /public/images:

/images/rightsize.svg – algorithm/footprint visual

/images/data-study.svg – flow/throughput chart or heatmap

/images/simulation.svg – simulated conveyors/buffers

/images/floorplan.svg – layout wireframe

/images/procurement.svg – RFQ/value matrix

/images/installation.svg – site photo or commissioning graphic

/images/daifuku.svg and /images/modula.svg – partner logos

In the file, update the STEPS array image fields and the PARTNER_LOGOS list. No layout changes needed.

How the page is structured (what to edit)

Hero: headline + subhead—keep short and outcome‑oriented.

Process flow: 6 cards (your categories), each with:

kicker (tiny label), title, summary, bullets, and image.

Partners: grid of logos (SVGs).

CTA: single focused call to action.

Visual rhythm & whitespace tips

The grid uses 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile—keeps it airy.

Cards have subtle motion on scroll, not gimmicky.

Use monochrome partner logos by default; switch to color on hover if you like. (You can add a grayscale→color hover effect by adding a .partner-logo:hover { filter: none; transform: scale(1.03); } rule and defaulting to filter: grayscale(100%).)

Content guidance (what to write in each step)

Right‑Size the Facility

Summary: what the algorithm does; input/output.

Bullets: inputs (order profile, SKUs, growth), outputs (footprint, constraints), scenario slider.

Data Study & Throughput Modeling

Summary: method + accuracy.

Bullets: peak vs avg, storage profiles, envelopes → equipment class.

Concept Design & Simulation

Summary: prove before build.

Bullets: digital twin, bottlenecks, iterate to ROI.

Floorplans & Travel Optimization

Summary: travel-time + real estate efficiency.

Bullets: aisle/dock logic, modules/AMRs/sortation, code-ready.

Value Engineering & Procurement

Summary: quotes + TCO.

Bullets: apples-to-apples, spec checks, lead‑time alignment.

Installation & Commissioning

Summary: controls + mechanical through go‑live.

Bullets: FAT/SAT, training, post‑go‑live KPIs.

Aesthetic guardrails (so it never feels cluttered)

Keep each summary ≤ 2 sentences, 3 bullets max (already wired).

Prefer line icons or simple SVGs over stock photos.

If an image is busy, keep the next card’s image minimal to avoid noise.

Maintain consistent visual height for partner logos.
