You’re editing a Next.js 14+ (App Router) repo: intralog-headless. Tailwind is enabled. Dark mode uses the dark class on <html> with CSS vars in globals.css. Do not add inline <style> blocks that could cause hydration diffs.

Goal

When a user clicks a top-level nav tab (not just the dropdown), they should land on a well-structured index page:

/design-build → shows Our Process (first) then Why Design-Build

/solutions → 3 columns: By Function, By Industry, By Technology (links go to existing pages)

/software → “Our Software” with cards for each product (links to existing detail pages)

/services → same 3-column pattern as Solutions but for Services

/resources → a single long page that aggregates Project Spotlights (Case Studies), Videos, Blog

Keep styling consistent with existing site (cards, section spacing, dark mode). No CLS or flash when theme toggles.

Files to create/update
1) Update the nav so top-level items are clickable

File: components/Header.tsx (or layout/Header.tsx if that’s where it lives)

Ensure each top-level menu item has an href to its index page while preserving the existing dropdowns.

“Design-Build” → /design-build

“Solutions” → /solutions

“Software” → /software

“Services” → /services

“Resources” → /resources

On desktop, hovering still shows the submenu; on click, navigate to the index page.

On mobile, tapping the label should navigate; the chevron (if any) can expand submenus.

2) Design-Build index (compose existing subpages)

Create: app/design-build/page.tsx

Refactor the two existing subpages into reusable sections if needed:

Move “Our Process” into components/design-build/ProcessSection.tsx

Move “Why Design-Build” into components/design-build/WhySection.tsx

page.tsx imports those and renders:

hero with title “Design-Build”

<ProcessSection />

<WhySection />

Ensure cards/steps increment visually; dark mode backgrounds use CSS vars (no hardcoded hex blacks).

3) Solutions index (3 columns of lists)

Create: app/solutions/page.tsx

Render a hero “Solutions” and a 3-column responsive grid:

By Function → links that already exist under /solutions/by-function/*

By Industry → /solutions/by-industry/*

By Technology → /solutions/by-technology/*

Use data arrays in the file so it’s easy to add/remove links. Each item: { href, label, blurb? }

Each link is a small card: title, optional 1-line blurb, right-chevron; respects dark mode.

4) Software index (cards)

Create: app/software/page.tsx

Title: “Our Software”. Below, cards for each product (name + 1–2 line description + link):

Warehousr

Density Pro

Painless Permit

(include any others already routed under /software/*)

The href for each card points to the existing detail page.
